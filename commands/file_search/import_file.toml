Upload a file using the Gemini Files API, then import it into a File Search Store.
This flow is ideal for large binary files or when attaching metadata to your document.

Arguments:
• file_path:str       (required) Path to the file to upload.
• display_name:str    (optional) Custom display name for this document.

Notes:
- This two-step process first uploads the file, then imports it to a persistent File Search Store.
- Useful for PDF, DOCX, or mixed-format datasets.
- Uploaded raw files expire after 48 hours, but indexed data persists indefinitely.

Example:
• /file_search:import_file file_path="network_design.pdf"
• /file_search:import_file file_path="/tmp/config_dump.json" display_name="Switch Config Dump"

Returns:
→ The File Search Store name containing the imported file.
